Now the LORD said to Abram, 

“Go forth from your country, 

And from your relatives 

And from your father’s house,

To the land which I will show you; 

And I will make you a great nation, 

And I will bless you, 

And make your name great;

And so you shall be a blessing;
```

- **(Genesis 28:[16-17])**

``` 
Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, 
“Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.” 
And he was afraid and said, 
“How awesome is this place! 
This is none other than the house of God,
and this is the gate of heaven.”
``` 

- **(2 Cor. 4:[1-4], NASB): Paul’s Apostolic Ministry, [:5-6]**:

``` 
For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, 
and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake. 
For God, who said, 
“Light shall shine out of darkness,” 
is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the light of
the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. 
```

- **(Philippians 1:[8-11]: Thanksgiving, NASB)**

``` 
For God is my witness, how I long for you all
with the affection of Christ Jesus.
And this I pray, that your love may abound still more
and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
so that you may approve the things that are excellent,
in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ;
having been filled with the fruit of righteousness
which comes through Jesus Christ,
to the glory and praise of God.

Although it is not assumed that the reader has taken differential equations or a linear algebra class, there are short introductions to many of these concepts. Following a short history of computing, the MATLAB environment is introduced. Next, vectors and matrices are discussed, followed by matrix-vector operations. The core programming elements of MATLAB are introduced in three successive chapters on scripts, loops, and conditional logic. The last three chapters outline how to manage the input and output of data, create professional quality graphics and find and use MATLAB toolboxes. Throughout, biomedical and life science examples are used to illustrate MATLAB's capabilities.
